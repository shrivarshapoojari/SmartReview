Severity definitions---



- Critical — data loss, remote code execution, auth bypass, leaking production secrets, or anything that can lead to full system compromise or large data breach. Must not merge.## Severity definitions

- High — serious security bugs, data corruption, major correctness bugs, or major performance regressions in production flows. Fix before merge.

- Medium — non-trivial correctness issues, potential bugs under uncommon conditions, maintainability problems. Fix before or immediately after merge depending on risk.* **Critical** — data loss, remote code execution, auth bypass, leaking production secrets, or anything that can lead to full system compromise or large data breach.
