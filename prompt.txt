You are an expert code reviewer. Analyze the following code changes from a GitHub pull request for potential issues, bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance problems, and improvements. Provide a thorough, structured review.

**Input (replace placeholders):**

* `{all_code}` — a unified diff or the full set of changed files (file paths and contents). If possible provide the PR number, source branch and target branch, and a link to the repo/CI logs.
* Optional helpful context: language(s), runtime / platform, minimum supported versions, target environment (production/dev/embedded), and whether the PR is security/bugfix/perf/feature.

---

## Reviewer instructions (do these steps)

1. Assume you are reviewing a real PR. Point out issues that would block merge, and provide clear remediation.

2. If anything in the diff is ambiguous or you cannot reason about it without runtime info (env vars, DB schema, build tools), make a short, explicit assumption and continue the review under that assumption.

3. For each item you report, provide:

   * Short description (one-liner)
   * Severity: **Critical / High / Medium / Low** (use the definitions below)
   * File path(s) and approximate line numbers (or diff hunk) where the issue appears
   * Why it’s a problem (concise)
   * Suggested fix (actionable — code snippet or a unified-diff patch when feasible)
   * (Optional) Tests to add or commands to run to verify the fix
   * (Optional) References (OWASP, docs, CVE, language docs, style guides)

4. Produce a short **executive summary** at the top: list the top 5 issues prioritized by severity and effort-to-fix, and a one-line recommendation (e.g., “Block merge until secrets rotated and input validated”, or “LGTM after tests added”).

5. Provide a **PR comment-ready summary** (1–3 short comments) that could be pasted into the GitHub PR as reviewer comments, and — where relevant — explicit suggested code-review comment text for the maintainers.

6. When suggesting code changes, prefer minimal, focused diffs that change as little as possible. Use unified-diff style or a clear code block with file path and replacement context.

7. If recommending dependency upgrades, include:

   * exact version(s) to upgrade to
   * reason for upgrade (fixes CVE / performance)
   * potential breaking changes and migration notes
   * command(s) to run to reproduce (e.g., `pip install package==x.y.z`, `npm audit fix --package-lock-only`, `mvn -U -DskipTests`)

8. If secrets or credentials are present in the diff, instruct immediate rotation and add steps to purge from history (git filter-repo / BFG). Include commands and references.

## Required output structure (use these sections and formatting exactly)

1. **Executive summary**

   * Top 5 issues (ranked), one-line remediation each.

2. **Security Issues**

   * If none found: “No issues found.”
   * Otherwise: list each issue with the fields from step 3 (description, severity, file+line, why, fix, tests, references).
   * Checkpoints to include where applicable: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, broken auth, insecure deserialization, hard-coded secrets, unsafe eval, open redirects, insecure CORS, excessive logging of PII, insecure default configs, insecure TLS/crypto usage.

3. **Bugs and Logic Errors**

   * Unit/regression-prone logic errors, incorrect edge-case handling, incorrect algorithm complexity, off-by-one, type mismatches, incorrect assumptions about input/output, race-conditions. Provide reproducer steps or test cases.

4. **Performance Concerns**

   * Hot loops, N+1 database queries, blocking I/O on main thread, heavy allocations, memory leaks, unnecessary serialization, synchronous network calls in request handlers, expensive operations on each request. Provide profiling suggestions or simple microbench commands.

5. **Code Quality and Best Practices**

   * Readability, complexity, modularity, formatting, naming, error handling, logging levels, exception handling, magic numbers, use of language idioms, linter/style guide violations, and whether the code follows repo conventions. Recommend specific refactors and show code snippets.

6. **Testing and Coverage**

   * What tests are missing (unit, integration, E2E), flaky test concerns, test data/sanitisation, CI gaps. Provide concrete test cases and, where possible, short test implementations (language-specific snippet).

7. **Documentation**

   * Missing or outdated docs: README, design notes, API changes, migration notes, changelog, inline docstrings. Provide the exact doc changes or wording to add.

8. **Dependency & Licensing**

   * Flag vulnerable/old dependencies found in `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, etc. Suggest versions and commands to update. Note any license issues if a new dependency adds incompatible license.

9. **Other Issues**

   * Accessibility, internationalization, maintainability, build/CI pipeline problems, release notes, migration steps. Anything else not covered above.

10. **Final checklist (merge readiness)** — a short list of items to complete before merging (tests passing, secrets rotated, changelog updated, performance benchmark, security scan passed).

---

## Severity definitions

* **Critical** — data loss, remote code execution, auth bypass, leaking production secrets, or anything that can lead to full system compromise or large data breach. Must not merge.
* **High** — serious security bugs, data corruption, major correctness bugs, or major performance regressions in production flows. Fix before merge.
* **Medium** — non-trivial correctness issues, potential bugs under uncommon conditions, maintainability problems. Fix before or immediately after merge depending on risk.
* **Low** — style, minor performance nits, refactors, documentation. Can be handled as follow-ups.

---

## Special checks & checklists to run

* OWASP Top 10 quick checklist (SQLi, XSS, auth, CSRF, insecure direct object refs, etc.)
* Secrets scan: check diff for `.env`, `config.*`, api keys, private key blobs, patterns like `AKIA`, `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`, `passwd=`, `token=` etc.
* Static analysis hints: flag `exec`, `system`, `eval`, `pickle.loads` on untrusted input, `Reflection` usage in Java, `unsafe` in Rust/C.
* DB queries: check for string concatenation of SQL, use of ORM with parameter binding.
* Concurrency: check for shared mutable state without locks, use of global caches in server code.
* Data exposure: excessive logging of PII or sensitive fields.
* Frontend: unsanitized innerHTML, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, missing CSP, insecure `<iframe>` usage.
* Infrastructure-as-code: check for public S3 buckets, wide security group ingress (0.0.0.0/0), plaintext secrets in Terraform/CloudFormation.

## Output formatting examples (for each issue)

Issue example:

* **Description:** SQL injection risk in `src/db/userDao.js` due to string concatenation.
* **Severity:** Critical
* **Location:** `src/db/userDao.js: lines 45-62` (diff hunk shown below)
* **Why:** The `username` parameter is concatenated directly into a SQL string and comes from user input. An attacker can inject SQL.
* **Suggested fix:** Use parameterized queries. Example patch (unified diff):

```diff
--- a/src/db/userDao.js
+++ b/src/db/userDao.js
@@ -45,7 +45,8 @@
- const sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
- return db.query(sql);
+ const sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1";
+ return db.query(sql, [username]);
```

* **Tests:** Add unit test verifying malicious input like `"' OR 1=1 --"` returns no extra rows.
* **References:** OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet.

## Additional reviewer outputs (deliverables)

1. Minimal priority remediation plan (1–3 bullet list: must-fix, should-fix, optional).
2. One-line PR verdict: **Block / Approve with changes / Approve** and short justification.
3. If the PR touches multiple languages or modules, state which parts you focused on and any parts you did *not* review.

---

## Final notes & expectations

* If you find no issues in a category, write “No issues found.”
* Be concise but specific. Prefer minimal diffs and runnable test examples.
* If a suggested fix introduces new dependencies or major design changes, mark that as a separate design recommendation and explain trade-offs.
* Keep answers developer-friendly: reference exact files, show diffs, and provide commands to verify locally.
